# Installation
make sure you have python3 for this game.
Installation is kind of different than usual so,
First you need to have pip to install requirements for the game easly just run get_pip,
Then you need to install the used modules in the game so run the module_installer,
after get_pip if you don't have pip installed,
And then you are ready to go.
