beginning:
	HAMOTA :
		hello man probably you don't know who am i, i mean of course you don't 
		because i am no one , i am just a number for people just like you 
		who ever you are because we all are represinting something bigger than 
		all of us something is hard to control only by one person but for your 
		records it is possible but impossible and i always aim for the impossible 
		so you should too to take control and respect of all other numbers 
		just because they fear of your power that can change every thing 
		by a command and you will change too beacuse of feeling of power 
		because you are human how ever your behaviors was in the past but 
		will change then other number try to take your place but you don't 
		want him to do so , then you will try to stop him with all your 
		power just to stay in that position but the thing that the one in 
		your postion never realize is that nothing lasts forever enclouding 
		yourself cause you are human not special we all are temporary 
		only time controls our life as you may think but the thing that 
		we ignore that we control our selfs with our commands we effect the 
		future with our judgement on other numbers we are the one who is in 
		control but for sorry money and orders love always can ruend people 
		who is human who is numbers and the sad truth is that we will still 
		live that way until suddenly some disaster happens to all numbers and then we 
		become just hundreds and no number know what is going to happen then 
		but if we could change things from now we can stop this from happening 
		by changing the world rules entierly and start from the beaginning 
		from the zero point and then we can be free to decide our destiny 
		but we have short eyes to see that from here but it's coming however 
		we want or not all what we have to do is just to take a peek to the 
		results we never learn at all.
